<p><strong>(15) Dispute Resolution – Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>
<p>(i) Contact Plastc First. If a dispute arises between you and Plastc, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Disputes between you and Plastc arising from the Services may be reported to Plastc’s customer service by email at <a class="__cf_email__" href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" data-cfemail="91f2feffe5f0f2e5d1e1fdf0e2e5f2bff2fefc">[email&nbsp;protected]</a><script type="text/javascript">

<p>(ii) <strong>Agreement to Arbitrate. You and Plastc each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Plastc shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding single arbitration with a single arbitrator, rather than in court. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> </p>
<p>(iii) Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief.</p>
<p><strong>YOU AND PLASTC AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PLASTC AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#8217;S OR PARTY&#8217;S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY&#8217;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES.</strong></p>
<p>(iv) Arbitration Procedures.</p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator also must follow the terms of these Terms and Conditions as a court would. 
The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&#8220;<strong>AAA</strong>&#8221;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA&#8217;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Article C(15). The AAA&#8217;s rules and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings are available on the AAA&#8217;s website at <a href="http://www.adr.org">http://www.adr.org</a>.  For consumer claimants (i.e., individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family, or household use), the arbitration shall be held in the county which you designated as your place of residence during your registration with Plastc, or at another mutually agreed location. For all other claimants, the arbitration shall be held in the County of Santa Clara, California, or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Plastc may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Plastc subject only to the arbitrator&#8217;s discretion to require an in-person hearing if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Plastc, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.  The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Plastc Card users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Plastc Card user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator&#8217;s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>(v) Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#8217;s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Article C(15). You and Plastc will each pay their own costs and expenses. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Plastc for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Plastc on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA&#8217;s rules.</p>
<p>(vi) Exceptions to Arbitration. Notwithstanding anything which could be interpreted to the contrary herein, we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>

To that end, purchasing the Plastc Card and the Services is strictly limited to those individuals who are at least 13 years of age (with the consent of a parent or legal guardian if a minor).

However, in the event that it comes to our attention that we have collected any data from or relating to a minor in any form that is not anonymized, we will promptly destroy that data, and will not distribute it to others, or keep copies thereof (other than, at our option, in a “deleted or destroyed information” file, to be used solely to evidence the destruction and non-use of that minor’s information).</p>
